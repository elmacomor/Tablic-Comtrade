# Project:Tablic

Tablic is an implementation of the popular card game "Tablic".Our implementation refers to the two-player version of the game that is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. In this implementation, we have used the Go (Golang) programming language and integrated a PostgreSQL database.

## How to Install and Run the Project

Before you start the Tablic project, you will need following software installed on your machine:

- Go(Golang) : Make sure you have Go installed. If not, you can download and install it from the official website:[Golang Instalation](https://golang.org/)

- PostgreSQL Database: Ensure that you have PostgreSQL installed and running on your system. You can download and install it from the official website: [PostgreSQL Instalation](https://www.postgresql.org/). Remember password you entered in installation process!

After that you should do the following steps:

- .env file:

It is necessary to create an .env file with the following constants:

- PORT

- HOST

- DB_PORT

- USER

- PASSWORD

- DB_NAME

- SECRET

* Configure PostgreSQL:

Create a new PostgreSQL database for the Tablic project.

Update the database connection details (e.g., username, password, database name) in the .env file.

- Databese migration:

To create the necessary tables in the database, you need to run the migrate.go script. This script handles the database schema migration and sets up the required tables.

To run the database migration, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and execute the following command:

```go

go run migrate.go

```

Running the database migration script is a one-time setup process. You should only run it once, when setting up the application for the first time or when applying database schema changes.

- Run the Project:

Once the setup is completed, you can run the application by executing the following command in the terminal:

```go

go run main.go

```

has context menu

### Endpoint for starting game

This endpoint is called when user wants to start the new game. User needs to enter his name/nickname and the endpoint is called and the user is placed in a queue
where he waits for the other player to join so the game can be started.

```golang

#Adds new player to the database and calls a function for starting the game
router.POST("/addPlayer", addPlayerHandler)

```

Data that the endpoint requests

```JSON

{
    "name:":"Player1"
}

```

The format of the response received when calling this endpoint is:

```JSON

### Endpoint for creating new deck

This endpoint is called when creating a new deck of cards. The response returned by this endpoint is in JSON format and contains field: "response". The "response" field represents a set of field: "success", "deck_id", "shuffled" and "remaining". In this app, two main fields from this endpoints are "deck_id" which present unique number of deck and "remaining" which present number of cards in deck.

# returns new deck

### Endpoint for return cards from hand of player and cards from table

This endpoint is called when player want see his cards from hands and cards from table. This endpoint must be secured from other player, because the other player cannot see his cards. Protection is enabled through the implementation of JWT tokens, where the player, during his game, contains a token with which he is authenticated. Each secure route contains a "Middleware" function that performs certain authentication. The parameters received by this endpoint are "userId" and "deckId", which are used to find player cards in a particular game. The response returned by this endpoint is in JSON format and contains two fields: "Cards_from_table" and "User_hand_cards". "Cards_from_table" field represents a set of cards on the table containing the subfields "image", "value", "suit" and "code", while "User_hand_cards" represents a set of cards of player containing the same subfields like first field.

### Endpoint for throw card on table

This endpoint is called when player want to throw card on table. This endpoint must be secured from other player, because the other player from other game cannot throw his card. Protection is enabled through the implementation of JWT tokens, where the player, during his game, contains a token with which he is authenticated. Payload in token hold deck_id which game can be authorized. The parameters received by this endpoint are "cardCode", "deckId" and "playerPile", where "cardCode" present card who player want throw, "deckId" present game in which the player plays and unique deck with cards which is used in game, "playerPile" present cards in hands from where the player throws the card. The response returned by this endpoint is in JSON format and contains two fields: "message", "table_cards" and "user_hand_cards". "Message" field represent message after successfully throw card ("The card is thrown on the table"), "table_cards" field represents a set of cards on the table containing the subfields "image", "value", "suit" and "code", while "user_hand_cards" represents a set of cards of player containing the same subfields like first field.

### Endpoint for take card from table

This endpoint is called when player want to take card from table. This endpoint must be secured from other player, because the other player from other game cannot throw his card.

### Endpoint for create authorization JWT token

This endpoint is used for create JWT authorization token. Token should be created after user get in game. JWT token used for authorization routes: route for listing player cards in hand, route for throwing card on table and route for take card/cards from table. The parameters received by this endpoint are "userID" and "deckId", where "deckId" present game in which the player plays and unique deck with cards which is used in game, "userId" present id of user. The response returned by this endpoint is in JSON format and contain tfield: "token". The "token" field represent JWT token after successfully created them. JWT token payload consists of fields "user_id", "deck_id" and "exp". Field "user_id" uses for checing authorization in route for listing player hand cards, while "deck_id" uses for authorization in route for throwing card on table and takeing card/cards from table.

# returns JWT player token

URL "/gettoken/:userId/:deckId"

The format of the response received when calling this endpoint is:

```JSON

# json response

# Metrics

Metrics are numerical parameters important for monitoring application performance.

They are used to return the number of requests, the time required for the response, the number of connections to the database, and the like.

The Prometheus and Grafana platforms were used to display the metrics in this application.

# The analyzed metrics are:

The number of failed connections to the base

Number of code parsing failures

Number of successful and unsuccessful calls endpoint to the card show

Number of successful and failed endpoint calls to start the game

The number of successful and unsuccessful calls endpoint to throw cards on the table

Number of successful and unsuccessful calls endpoint for taken cards

# An example of creating a metric to track the number of errors when connecting to a database:

````go
